  <p>Family weekend tickets permit access into the designated Family Campsite. This ticket allows entry for one adult and up to two children under the age of 12. Children aged 12 years and under must be pre-registered prior to the event.<br>
    Those wishing to stay in the Family Campsite must be accompanied by children 12 years or younger. No single or groups of adults without children will be admitted entry. The Family campsites are restricted in space and therefore must be reserved solely for families with children.

  <h1>CAMPERVAN AND CARAVAN TICKETS </h1>
  <p>All customers will be sent a sticker to go on their windscreen and will be unable to gain admittance without this sticker, a booking confirmation page is not enough to gain entry. All campervan occupants must have weekend camping tickets to gain access the campervan area. Please note for campervan/caravan passes the purchaser will be required to bring the original proof of purchase to site along with their pass.  This is to prevent touting of campervan passes.<br>
    Due to a number of campervan/caravan passes going missing in the past, we will now be charging €15 extra for a secure delivery method to ensure tickets are delivered to the original purchaser.<br>
    Please ensure you select the correct ticket for the type of vehicle you will be bringing into the festival site: the options are campervan or caravan + car. These tickets are not interchangeable on site.<br>
    Separate fields for ticket holders to park campervans and caravans are provided within the festival site.<br>
    These fields are split into two sections -<br>
    Family Campervan/Caravan + Car only available with family camping tickets and you must specify this when buying your family campervan ticket so that the correct routing sticker can be sent to you.<br>
    Standard Campervan/Caravan + Car only available with standard weekend tickets and you must specify this when buying your campervan tickets so that the correct routing stickers can be sent to you.<br>
    Phone and Internet bookings are subject to 12.5% service charge per ticket (Max €6.10)<br>
    Please ensure you have read our Campervan and Caravan Terms and Conditions.</p>
  <h1>LOYALTY TICKET OFFER</h1>
  <p>The Loyalty Ticket Offer for Electric Picnic 2019 is now finished.<br>
    If you wish to automatically receive your loyalty code for future Electric Picnic events from Ticketmaster, please ensure you’re signed up to receive marketing emails from Ticketmaster.<br>
    Please note that tickets are subject to availability. The loyalty scheme (and use of discount codes) will end at Midnight Sunday 30th September, or in the event of a sell-out of the allocation, whichever comes first. A discount code or request for a discount code does not guarantee a ticket purchase and tickets are sold on a first come first serve basis. Requests for codes are dealt with on a first come first serve basis and requests without obvious proof may take longer to research, process and return codes. We cannot guarantee to supply a discount code requested after Midnight on Monday, 24th September. The number of available discounted tickets are limited and receipt of a discount code does not guarantee a purchase of a ticket(s). Tickets may sell out before the stated deadlines. The use of discount codes will end once the loyalty tickets have sold out.</p>
